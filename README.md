## Summary

Dusek et al. assessed the transcriptional profile of whole blood collected from long-term practitioners of daily relaxation response (RR) practice (i.e. deep breathing, meditation) and controls. Controls then took part in a 8-week RR practice with training/education. Whole blood was collected before and after this 8-week RR practice. For this analysis, controls were treated as two groups: no RR practice and 8-week RR practice. These groups, along with the long-term RR practice group, were then compared to identify differentially expressed genes with the top 10 discriminant genes further assessed for their biological function. Clustering and classification methods were also utilized to evaluate if these groups exhibit distinct genetic characteristics.
